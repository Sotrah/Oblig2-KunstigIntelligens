**Machine learning**

**Pick one use case (defined below)**

  1.Tesla stock prediction.
  
**Explore and research which algorithm would work best for this use case (regression or classification)**

  For this case, regression
  
**Document your findings in a file (3-5 lines) on why you chose this algorithm.**

  We started with reading through the Machine learning powerpoints from canvas to get a general idea. At first we wanted to do the Ruter task, though we found out that it looked less suitable than the Tesla task.     Therefore we chose that instead. The algorithm we used was the RandomForest, that we also tried to use on the Ruter task. 
  We found through this project that we could use RandomForest, though it might not be the most optimal algorithm for this use case.
